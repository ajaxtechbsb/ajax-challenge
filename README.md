## Hey, stranger!


So... First of all, thank you for your time and welcome to the Ajax Tech Internship challenge,  and without furter ado, let's get to it!


Starting our process, we have a short challenge. It should be somehow easy to make.


Our recommendations:
-Create a README.md file containing all important information to understand and run the code

-Laravel 5.4

-MariaDB or MongoDB if you choose to use a database

-Any PHP public module should be managed via composer

-It can have a GUI, but a CLI is enough if you choose so, anyway we need a README to avoid wasting time

-Be delivered as a github.com public project named as ajax-challenge until next friday (11 of august, 2017) 6pm. Also send us an email with your github account and the project URL (That's important!), the email adress is down below.


The challenge is to crawl data from one or more of these links...
