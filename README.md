## Hey, stranger!  

So... First of all, thank you for your time and welcome to the Ajax Tech Internship challenge,  and without further ado, let's get to it!

Starting our process, we have a short challenge. It should be somehow easy to make.

Our recommendations:
- Create a README.md file containing all important information to understand and run the code

- Laravel 5.4

- MariaDB or MongoDB if you choose to use a database

- Any PHP public module should be managed via composer

- Should be created as API, with all methods http.

The challenge is to create an ATM (cash machine) system.

But it's not that easy. You should follow the rules below.

1. Only the following cells must be removed: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100.

2. You must remove as few cells as possible

3. This routes should be created to this operations:

'GET': Verify balance

'POST': Transfer money

'PUT': Deposit money

'DELETE': To withdraw money

4. Upload app on Github and Heroku, send urls to camilo.fernandes@ajaxtech.online

Obs: Any futher doubt about the info above an issue can be created on this git repo.
